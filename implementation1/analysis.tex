\section*{Asymptotic Analysis}
    \begin{enumerate}

    \item In algorithm 1 the problem is not branched into any subproblems.
          With the nested for loops there is a comparison made between
          every element in the input, leading to an intuitive asymptotic
          complexity of $O(n^2)$

	\item In algorithm 2 the problem is branched into $2$ subproblems
          for size $n/2$ at each level.

    \item In algorithm 3 the problem is branched into $2$ subproblems of size
          $n/2$ at each level.  The depth of the problem is $log_2 of n$
          and the width is $n^log_2 2$.  From the master theorem we know
          that $A/B^D$ determines the run time complexity.  Since this
          case is $2/2^1 = 1$, we know that the Asymptotic complexity is
          $O(n log n)$.

    \end{enumerate}
