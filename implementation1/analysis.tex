Asymptotic Analysis of run time:
	In algorithm 1 the problem is not branched into any subproblems.  With the nested for loops there is a comparison made between every element in the input, leading to an intuitive asymptotic complexity of $O(n^2)$
	In algorithm 2 the problem is branched into $2$ subproblems fo size $n/2$ at each level.  
	In algorithm 3 the problem is branched into $2$ subproblems of size $n/2$ at each level.  The depth of the problem is $log_2 of n$ and the width is $n^log_2 2$.  From the master theorem we know that $A/B^D$ determines the run time complexity.  Since this case is $2/2^1 = 1$, we know that the Asymptotic complexity is $O(n log n)$.
